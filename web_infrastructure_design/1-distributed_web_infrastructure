# Task 1: Distributed web infrastructure

- Three Servers: Adding three servers provides redundancy. If one server fails, the other two can keep the system running, making the infrastructure more resilient and minimizing downtime.

- Round-Robin Algorithm: The load balancer distributes incoming requests evenly among the available servers by cycling through them one at a time in sequence. This ensures all servers share the traffic load equally.

### Is Your Load Balancer Enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive Setup? Explain the Difference Between Both
- Active-Active Setup: Both servers work simultaneously to handle requests, sharing the traffic load to improve performance and availability.
- Active-Passive Setup: Only the active server handles traffic, while the passive server remains on standby as a backup. The passive server is used only if the active server fails.
### How a Database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Cluster Works and the Difference Between the Primary Node and the Replica Node Regarding the Application
- Primary-Replica Cluster: This setup manages databases by having one main database (Primary) and one or more backup databases (Replicas).
- Primary Database: The main database where all data changes (e.g., additions, updates, deletions) occur.
- Replica Database: A backup database that makes exact copies of the primary database. It handles read-only tasks, while the primary focuses on data modification tasks.

This division of responsibilities enhances performance because read requests are offloaded to replicas, leaving the primary to handle changes efficiently.

## Isues: 

- Single Point of Failure (SPOF): The load balancer or database primary node could become a SPOF if not set up redundantly.
- Security Issues: Lack of a firewall and HTTPS leaves the system vulnerable to attacks.
- No Monitoring: Without a monitoring system, identifying and resolving issues proactively is challenging.
